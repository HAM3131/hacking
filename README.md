# hacking
A repository for all my work on CTF events and other hacking while at OSU!!

# Objective
Starting in the 2023 school year, I have participated in a couple of CTF events within the first two weeks of classes. Last year, I participated in the BuckeyeCTF, which whetted my appetite for these challenges. Now, I want to have a central place to store the knowledge I am gaining from doing these challenges!

So far this year, I have participated in:
 - SekaiCTF 2023
 - DownUnderCTF 2023
