# speedrun13
Hey! A very simple solution for this one. Note that the way `x` is generated is with the `srand()` function, and the seed we give to this random function is `time(0)`. `time(0)` give the second on the system, so if we connect once, give a random number, and read the `x` that they generated and gave back to us with
``` {c}
printf("Got: %d\nExpected: %d\n", x, answer);
```
We can then run the program a second time knowing the value of `x`, and send that, giving us the window.

# Solution
```{python}
from pwn import *

path_to_binary = "./challenge/chall_13"
EXE = ELF(path_to_binary)
context.binary = EXE

def conn(useExe=False):
	if useExe:
		r = process([EXE.path])
	else:
		r = remote('pwn.osucyber.club',13387)
	return r

io = conn()

io.sendline("0")

flag = "Expected: "
io.recvuntil(flag)
x = io.recvline()
io.close()

io = conn()
io.sendline(x)
io.interactive()
```
