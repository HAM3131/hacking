1; _ans = global.process.mainModule.require('fs').readdirSync('.').toString()
ALTERNATIVE: 1; _ans = this.require('fs').then(fs => { return fs.readdirSync('.')})

^^ This gives information about the files in the current directory

1; _ans = global.process.mainModule.require('fs').readFileSync('could_this_be_the_flag.txt').toString()
ALTERNATIVE: 1; _ans = this.require('fs').then(fs => { return fs.readFileSync('could_this_be_the_flag.txt').toString()})

^^ This reads the file which has been revealed by our previous input, and gives us the flag!

------------------------------------
Thought process:
Certainly! Let's break down the thought process behind the successful exploit:

Node.js Global Object and process:
In Node.js, global is the global namespace object, similar to the window object in the browser. 
The process object is a global that provides information about and control over the current Node.js process. 
As a global, it's available to applications without calling require().

Accessing the Main Module:
Every running Node.js application has a main module, which is the entry point to the application. 
This main module can be accessed via process.mainModule. The mainModule object is essentially a 
reference to the module that started the current Node.js process.

mainModule.require:
The mainModule object has a require method that acts similarly to the standard require method in 
Node.js, allowing you to load and cache external modules. Even if require isn't globally available 
(like in a browser environment or certain sandboxed environments), process.mainModule.require can 
often be used to bypass this restriction and load Node.js modules.

Loading the fs module:
Once we have a working require method, we can use it to load the built-in fs (filesystem) module, 
giving us the ability to perform file operations.

Using readdirSync('.'):
The readdirSync('.') method from the fs module is used to synchronously read the contents of the current 
directory (denoted by '.'). This was an initial step to identify potential files or directories of interest.

The key to this exploit is leveraging the properties and methods available on global objects, especially 
those unique to the Node.js environment, to bypass common restrictions and gain access to powerful functionalities like filesystem operations.
