# Script
To start testing, we are going to run our script on the ELF we were given for the challenge. We can load it like this:
```{python}

```
The `conn()` function being set up here simply allows us to minimally change the program to run remotely when we are finished with testing. Calling this function with `True` as a parameter connects to the local installation of the server executable, whose path is written in the definition of the `EXE` variable. Then once our testing is completed, we can call `conn(False)` to make a connection to the remote server.

Next, we connect and craft and send our payload:
```{python}

```

If this spawns a terminal, then our code worked! We can run it again on the server then call `ls` and `cat flag.txt` in the interactive shell!
