Find the modular inverse:
There is this really function called Extended Euclidean Algorithm, which will find the greatest common denominator of two numbers.
In and of itself, that's not very useful, but it also gives you two numbers x and y such that:
                Ax - By = gcd(A, B)
When used in the context of primes, if B is a prime, then (A % B)^-1, or the inverse of A mod B is x. HUUUUUGE for decryption.

A program that will solve this is located at Hack/codeSkeletons/extendedGCD.py
